DISCLAIMER: THIS IS AN ALPHA SOFTWARE.

DESCRIPTION: 
Smart Block Site helps users stay on task through "reward" and "punishment", without outright restricting websites. For everyone "good" site a person is on, they can earn points, which could be used to access distracting sites. 

This idea stems from how sometimes, people need to access, let's say, YouTube for work or school, but don't want to get distracted afterwards. Other block site only allows the website to be blocked or unblocked. Even if there are time limits, the settings less than ideal and too rigid. This extension offers a dynamic approach to the problem instead.

Even if a distracting site is in the background, the counter will still count down.

HOW TO USE: 
Specify sites you want to block below. Each site must be on a separate line. Sites starting with "!" will be exception to the rule and allowed.

Input a number in merit weight and demerit weight. This number is the number of points that gets incremented / decremented per second when on a good or distracting site.

Max Point Accumulated is optional. It sets a limit to how much points could be accumulated.
