Smart Block Site helps users stay on task through "reward" and "punishment", without outright restricting websites. 

For every minute a user is on a "merit site", they can earn points. For every minute a user is on a "demerit site", they lose points. The "demerit site" gets blocked once there are no more points left, and the user has to earn points again to re-access the "demerit site".

Features:
• Autofill Common Sites: Auto fills block sites with common distractors.
• Merit Weight: Points added per minute on merit sites.
• Demerit Weight: Points subtracted per minute on demerit sites.
• Enable/Disable Settings: Once enabled, points will reset if disabled.
• Maximum Points Accumulated: 
• Reset Points After Closure: Once enabled, points will reset if browser is closed.
• Permanent Block List: Permanently blocks websites. 
• Block By Category: Permanently block websites by category (adult).
